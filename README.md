# google-homepage
A google homepage clone;
This was an opportunity to create a clone of an easily recognizable webpage.
As someone who was in desperate need of a refresh when it came to basic HTML and CSS, this was really useful for pushing myself to reevaluate the way I write HTML elements and plan my styling. I found myself getting cluttered and removing elements if I found them difficult to style later on.

update 10/17- could use rework on fonts, some text colors slightly off
